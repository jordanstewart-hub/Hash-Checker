# 🔐 HashChecker

**HashChecker** is a simple Python tool that verifies the integrity of files by comparing their hash values against known values. It supports MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256 algorithms.

---

## ✅ Features

- File integrity verification
- Supports `md5`, `sha1`, and `sha256`
- Command-line interface (CLI)
- Lightweight and beginner-friendly

---

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.6+

No external libraries needed — uses Python's built-in `hashlib` and `argparse`.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔧 Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hashchecker.git
cd hashchecker
```

### ▶️ Run the script

```bash
python hashchecker.py --file sample.txt --hash <expected_hash> --algo sha256
```

---

## 💻 Example Usage

```bash
python hashchecker.py --file sample.txt \
                      --hash e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855 \
                      --algo sha256
```

**Output:**

```
Computed sha256 hash: e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855
✅ Hash match: File integrity verified.
